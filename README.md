# Chirag-Personal-Filters

[![syntax](https://img.shields.io/badge/syntax-AdGuard-%23c61300.svg)](https://kb.adguard.com/en/general/how-to-create-your-own-ad-filters)

A personal filterlist of mine with additional filters for Adguard to block third-party, tracking, annoyances, anti-adblock, popunders, resource-abuse and all other unwarranted resources.

Contains filters specific to Adguard and some filters that have not yet been added to other filterlists.

## Requirements

The requirements to use these lists in chromium based desktop browser is that AdGuard AdBlocker extension should be already installed on a chromium based desktop browser.

You can install the extension from [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/adguard-adblocker/bgnkhhnnamicmpeenaelnjfhikgbkllg).
