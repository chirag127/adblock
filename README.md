# Adguard-Personal-Filters

A personal filterlist of mine with additional filters for Adguard to block third-party, tracking, annoyances, anti-adblock, popunders, resource-abuse and all other unwarranted resources.

Contains filters specific to Adguard and some filters that have not yet been added to other filterlists.
