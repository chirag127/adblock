# Adguard-Personal-Filters

A personal filterlist of mine with additional filters for Adguard to block third-party, tracking, annoyances, anti-adblock, popunders, resource-abuse and all other unwarranted resources.

Contains filters specific to Adguard and some filters that have not yet been added to other filterlists.

# Disclaimer 

As this is a **personal** filterlist of mine, there maybe some filters that you disagree with and if you do, feel free to click on the **fork** button and make your own list.
