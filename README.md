# Chirag Personal Filter lists

[![syntax](https://img.shields.io/badge/syntax-AdGuard-%23c61300.svg)](https://kb.adguard.com/en/general/how-to-create-your-own-ad-filters)

A personal filter list of mine with additional filters for AdGuard to block third-party, tracking, annoyances, anti-adblock, resource-abuse and all other unwarranted resources.

Contains filters specific to AdGuard and some filters that have not yet been added to other filter lists.

## Requirements

The requirements to use these lists in chromium based desktop browser is that AdGuard AdBlocker extension should be already installed on a chromium based desktop browser.

You can install the extension from [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/adguard-adblocker/bgnkhhnnamicmpeenaelnjfhikgbkllg).

### AdGuard Tracking Protection List without domains [Subscribe](https://subscribe.adblockplus.org/?location=https://github.com/chirag127/adblock/raw/main/without_domains/AdGuard%20tracking.txt) [Download](https://github.com/chirag127/adblock/raw/main/without_domains/AdGuard%20tracking.txt)

> People using DNS blocking don't need to use the complete AdGuard Tracking Protection List as approx 80% rules of the AdGuard Tracking Protection List are domains which are already blocked by AdGuard DNS or other DNS blocking services. The same concept can not be applied to AdGuard Base as AdGuard extension also blocks the frame and placeholders of the domains and URLs blocked by it and if the user wants to block the frame and place blocks the placeholder of the ads, then the user needs to use the complete AdGuard Base filtering list.

As this is a **personal** filter list of mine, there maybe some filters that you disagree with and if you do, feel free to click on the **fork** button and make your own list.
